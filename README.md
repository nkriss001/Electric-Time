# Electric-Time

For this assignment, I had to create an Android application that would allow the user to select a method of transport and enter the distance they want to travel, and which would output the time it would take that transport to travel that distance. The image on the left shows the screen after opening the application. The drop-down menu prompts the user to click and select a transport from the given list, with transport options listed in alphabetical order. The text box prompts the user to enter a distance in miles. The user can only enter positive real numbers into the box.
